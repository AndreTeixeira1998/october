**App layout**

I found the following repos useful in terms of how to lay out this application, and other various development things

- [cawa-93/vite-electron-builder](https://github.com/cawa-93/vite-electron-builder)
- [jctaoo/vite-electron-esbuild-starter](https://github.com/jctaoo/vite-electron-esbuild-starter)

**Logo**

Base assets:

- Octopus and glasses icons from Google's [Noto Emoji](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji/) project
  - Used under the SIL Open Font License, visible under [assets/LICENSE](assets/LICENSE)
  - Mashup generated by Google Keyboard's [Emoji Kitchen](https://blog.google/products/android/emoji-kitchen-new-mashups-mixing-experience/)
  - The end result does not directly use images from the `noto-emoji` repo but does indirectly through Google Keyboard, so the SIL Open Font License is understood to still apply.
- Book image from [Merlin2525](http://www.freestockphotos.biz/stockphoto/14305)
  - Base image released under [Public Domain](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) by author and colour swapped from red to blue
- Final logo compiled from the above assets by The Oligopolist.
  - As a derivation of assets released under the SIL Open Font License, the same license still applies to the end result.
